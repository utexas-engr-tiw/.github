# Hey 👋 Welcome to the Texas Inventionworks Github Page
## If you're just observing feel free to have a look around the public files
## If you're a new developer for the project head on over to fabmanSync/backend and check out the README file there

Our goal here is to achieve seamless integration between Fabman and Canvas data points using AWS resources. 
Which allows UT Austin students to complete training modules in Canvas and then access our numerous machines within the Engineering Education and Research Center.

Take a deeper dive if you'd like to know more about the process and its benefits to the UT campus. If not, no worries, thanks for checking us out and have a wonderful day. 😊
